        <p>Thank you for your interest in completing this experiment. We want to ensure that you understand what is being recorded and how your data will be used!</p>
        <p><b>What you will do in this study:</b> As a participant, you will be asked to complete a simple “Simon Says” puzzle. 
        Four different colored buttons will appear on your screen.</p> <p>Once you are ready, the buttons will begin faintly flashing. 
        You will be tasked in remembering the order in which they lit up and then replicating it by clicking on each button in that pattern. The sequence will start small, with just a sequence of three of the buttons lighting up in a specific order, to a total of five.</p>
        <p>After you have completed that entire sequence, you will be asked two short questions, in which you will select the option that best represents your thoughts. If you at all feel uncomfortable or unsure about your answer, you can take a break, skip that question, or end the survey/experiment at any time. Once those questions have been answered, you will complete four more sessions, each with another sequence.</p>
        <p>Once you complete all five sessions, there will be a short questionnaire asking some questions about the experience, as well as yourself. Just as with the individual trials, you may refuse to answer any question by leaving it blank or ending the experiment if you do not wish to answer.</p>
        <p><b>Time Required:</b> The study will require about 15 minutes to complete.</p>
        <p><b>Benefits:</b> There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study.  The study may help us understand what feedback sounds software users respond to positively may help software developers choose their sounds without extensive focus group testing.</p>
        <p><b>Risks:</b> There are no anticipated risks in this study.</p>
        <p><b>Anonymity:</b> The information that you give in the study will be anonymous.  Your name will not be collected or linked to the data.</p>
        <ul>

                    <li>Survey Answers</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The data collected will be used for educational purposes only.</li>
            <li>No identifying information will be collected about the user.</li>
            <li>The data will be analyzed to find any relationship between the various participant answers to find a general trend, no specific individuals data will be highlighted.</li>
            <li>All recorded data will be safely erased seven months after the completion of the study.</li>
